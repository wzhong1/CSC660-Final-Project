	CSC 660 Final Project - Food order app Creator: William Zhong Student ID: 918136393

	Summary
	This simple food order app is designed by swiftUI. Users will be able to explore varieties of food options from different partnered restaurants every day. They can simply checkout in the app and have them delivered to your location.

	Introduction
	Nowaday I see a lot of people do not have time to travel back and forth for food due to their busy working schedule. Many companies already found these business opportunities and created this app for food ordering. Some popular apps like grubhub, doordash, and Ubereat, etc. These apps have millions of users using it every day. The only thing I noticed is that these apps are not friendly for people with disabilities. Therefore I am not only creating a food order app for normal people, but also for people with disabilities.

	Must have features:
	● Food menu of the day
	● Food Name
	● Food description
	● User menu
	● Shopping cart
	● Quantity of selection
	● Price listing
	● Delivery location
	● Restaurant selection
	● Review / Ratings
	● Map / GPS
	● Search
	● Pictures
	● Voice Navigation(People with visual impair)

	Nice to have features:
	● Membership discount
	● Delivery options
	● Deliver preference
	● Free delivery availability
	● Notification
	
	Additonal package used: Firebase, SDWebImageSwiftUI
